### Added

#### 🆕 Import/Export System

- **Drag & drop file import** - simply drop JSON files into the import area
- **Smart duplicate detection** with configurable merge options during import
- **Data validation** with comprehensive error handling for malformed files
- **Export range selection** - export all jumpmarks, selected items, or filtered results
- **Import preview** showing statistics before execution (total, new, duplicates)

#### 🎨 Advanced Management UI
- **Options page** with comprehensive jumpmark management interface
- **Search and filtering** with real-time results across titles and URLs
- **Bulk operations** - select multiple jumpmarks for deletion or export
- **Sorting options** by creation date, title, or URL

- **Dark mode support** automatically following system preferences

#### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Enhanced URL normalization** with automatic protocol detection and addition
- **Improved error handling** throughout the application with user-friendly messages

### Fixed

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Import duplicate detection logic** - corrected to prevent false positives with bidirectional links
- **URL normalization errors** - robust handling of protocol-less URLs (e.g., "google.com")
- **Table interaction issues** - eliminated unintended page navigation when clicking near buttons
- **Storage listener conflicts** - resolved duplicate UI updates during edit/delete operations
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - improved handling of various URL formats and edge cases

#### 🔒 Data Integrity
- **Import validation** - comprehensive checking of file format and data structure
- **Error recovery** - graceful handling of corrupted or incomplete data
- **Backward compatibility** - seamless migration from older data formats

### Technical

#### 📦 Build & Deployment
- **GitHub Actions workflows** updated to include all new files (options.html, options.js, options.css, shared.js)
- **Automated packaging** for Chrome Web Store submission with validation
- **Release automation** with comprehensive artifact generation

#### 🔧 Code Quality
- **Error boundary implementation** - prevents application crashes from malformed data
- **Input sanitization** - enhanced security for user-provided data
- **Performance optimization** - efficient handling of large jumpmark collections
